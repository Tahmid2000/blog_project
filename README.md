# blogsforall
Initially, this might just seem like a blogging website, but there is so much more to it than that.
Blogs For All evolved from a blog site to a social media site where you can like and comment on
your favorite posts and even give a follow to your favorite creators. The algorithm implemented will
only show you blogs that you will enjoy depending on your liked posts and the people you follow. Visit
Blogs For All to enjoy all the amazing features. If you want to see my weekly blogs, please follow me 
on Blogs For All @tahmidimran.
